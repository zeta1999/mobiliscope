		<h2>PRESENTATION</h2>
		</br>
		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Mobiliscope </span> is a geovisualization platform for the interactive exploration of neighborhood social composition over a 24 hour time period, taking into account how people move throughout the day.
		It is intended to help people (academic researchers, students, policymakers and practitioners, NGO, members of private sectors or ordinary citizens) explore cities around the clock.</p>
		
		<p> At least two reasons support the importance of exploring cities over the 24 hours of a day:
		<ul>
			<li>Neighborhood attributes and neighborhood effects both have to be considered as being dynamic.
			While social scientists have invested a lot of energy in exploring the uneven distribution of social groups in the city, they have surprisingly limited their efforts to investigating the social composition of the residential population. 
			Yet, when moving, inhabitants may be exposed to different social contexts and, conversely, transform the social context for the inhabitants who do not move. 
			Education, employment, or health issues could then be related not only to residential segregation (“night-time” segregation), but also to “day-time” segregation. </li>
			<li>Public and municipal actors may find it more efficient to implement interventions in areas with high concentrations of vulnerable population not only during the night but also during the day. 
			Crossing information about night-time and day-time segregation would then be useful for every public action aiming to reduce social inequalities in the city. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>DATA COMPUTATION </h2>

		<h3>Origin-destination survey </h3>
		<p> In the actual version of the Mobiliscope, data came from the Enquête Globale Transport - EGT (STIF, OMNIL, DRIEA), a large origin-destination survey carried out in 2010 in the Paris region.
		We are grateful to CEREMA (ex-Certu) and ADISP-CMH who have made these data available through «Réseau Quetelet»</p>
		
		<p>Every trip starting and/or ending in the Paris region made on the day before the survey was reported by respondents. Following variables were available for each trip: precise localization of place of departure and place of arrival (using a 100 square meters grid cell), time of departure and time of arrival (with exact minutes), trip purpose and mode of transportation used.</p>
		
		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">The trip dataset </span> was transformed into a <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">location dataset</span> in which: 
			<ul>
			<li>Every location was defined at district level (ie. the smallest unit in which it is relevant to aggregate data due to survey design);</li>
			<li>24 hourly time steps were defined to get 24 cross-sectional pictures of respondents' locations;</li>
			<li>Transportation periods were removed, except if respondents have reported to use an 'adherent' mode of transportation (ie. walking or cycling). In this case, half of the trip was considered as located in the district of origin and the other half as located in the district of destination. </li>
			</ul>
		<span style = "font-style : italic ;"> More methodological details can be found in the paper <a style = "color : black ; text-decoration : underline ;" target="_blank" href = "https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01472039/document">Social segregation around the clock in the Paris region</a>.</span></p>
		

		<h3>Studied population </h3>
		<p> Only respondents <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">aged 16 years or over </span> (sufficiently autonomous in their daily mobility) have been selected. To reduce spatiotemporal heterogeneity between trips occurring on weekends and on weekdays, we also restricted our dataset to <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">weekday trips </span>(Monday-Friday). 
		The sample of daily trips at weekends was indeed too small in the EGT survey to explore what happens during the weekends. Here, the final sample contains <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">25,714 respondents</span>  aged 16 or over with a total of 102,00 weekdays trips and 127,000 locations.</p>
		
		<p>Every measure published in the Mobiliscope has been estimated taking into account EGT <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">weighting coefficients</span>.
		Measures have been computed at household and individual levels to grant every district with the same distribution in household profile (size and housing type) and population profile (age, sex, occupation, and socioprofessional group) as the distribution observed in the 2008 French census. </p>
	

		<h3>Districts</h3>
		<p>The Paris region has been subdivided into <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">109 districts</span> (called 'secteurs' in EGT survey). 
		Districts are the primary sampling units in EGT survey. They correspond to groups of municipalities or arrondissements in Paris and consist of approximately 100,000 inhabitants. 
		The Mobiliscope only displays the name of the three more populated municipalities or arrondissements in every district.<span style = "font-style : italic ;"> See the complete <a style = "color : black ; text-decoration : underline ;" href = "pdf/EGTDistricts.pdf" target="_blank">list of municipalities in EGT districts.</a></span></p>
		
		<p> Smaller in inner Paris and larger in the peripheral areas, district sizes range from 3 to 1,326 km2 (with a median area of 14 km²).</br>
		At 3 am the number of respondents per district varies from 124 to 410, with a median of 231.
		At 3 pm the number of respondents per district varied from 69 to 741, with a median of 191. </p>
		

		<h3>Hourly measures</h3>
		<p>Estimated number/proportion of people <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">at district level</span> have been computed hourly (from 4:00 am to 3:00 am) taking into account weighting coefficients.</p>
		
		<p>Measures of spatial distribution <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">in the whole metropolitan area</span> have been computed hourly (from 4:00 am to 3:00 am) taking into account weighting coefficients.
		Two unigroup indices have been considered:
		<ul>
			<li> <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Duncan’s dissimilarity index</span> gives information about the dispersal of every group across spatial units. It is commonly used as a measure of pairwise segregation (e.g. Black versus White) but can also be used when measuring segregation through an indicator divided in more than two groups. In this case, Duncan’s dissimilarity index expresses the proportion of individuals of a given group who would have to change spatial unit (without being replaced) to get an even distribution of the group relative to the total population. </li>
			<li> <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Moran’s index</span> is a measure of spatial autocorrelation. Its value varies from -1 (the group perfectly repulses itself) to 1 (the group is perfectly clustered in space). A zero value indicates an absence of spatial structure. </li>
		</ul>
		

		<h3>Indicators</h3>
	
		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Demographic profile</span>
			<ul>
			<li><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Sex</span>: Female and Male.</br>
			Sample size = 25,714 respondents (no missing values)</li>
			</br>
			<li><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Age</span> divided into four groups: 17-24 years; 25-34 years; 35-64 years; 65 and more.</br>
			Sample size = 25,714 respondents (no missing values)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Social profile</span>
			<ul>
			<li>From respondents’ socioprofessional data (initially in 24 groups), we computed <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">socioprofessional status</span> corresponding to the lowest socioprofessional category of the adults in the household.</br>
			We distinguished five groups: unemployed (unemployed long term, housework); low (workers and domestic services); middle-low (employees, craftsmen); middle-high (intermediary professionals, merchants, farm operators); and high (managers, intellectual professionals, employers of more than 10 employees).</br>
			Sample size = 25,411 respondents (after exclusion of missing values).</li>
			</br>
			<li>From the respondents’ achieved level of education (initially in ten groups), we computed <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">educational status </span> corresponding to the lowest level of education of the adults in the household. </br>
			We distinguished four groups: low (middle school or less); middle-low (high school without Baccalauréat); middle-high (Up to two years after Baccalauréat); and high (three years or more after Baccalauréat). </br>
			Sample size = 25,654 respondents (after exclusion of missing values).</li>
			</br>
			<li> Total monthly household income has been divided by the number of adults and children in the household to get <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">household income</span> per consumption units (CU). </br>
			We distinguished four groups: low (< 1084€/CU); middle-low (1084-1806€/CU); middle-high (1806-2890€/CU); high (>2890€/CU).
			Income intervals have been defined according to median household income in the Paris region (equal to 1806€/CU in 2010). 
			The first threshold (1084€/CU) or 'poverty threshold’ corresponds to 60 % of median household income; the second one (1806€/CU) corresponds to the median household income; the third one (2890€/CU) correspond to 160 % of median household income. </br>
			Sample size = 23,899 respondents (after exclusion of missing values).</li>
			</br>
			<li>From respondents' occupational status, we divided <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">occupational status</span> into five groups: Inactive; Retired; Unemployed; Student; Active. </br>
			Sample size = 25,676 respondents (after exclusion of missing values). </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Residential area</span>
			<ul>
			Respondents' <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">departments of residence</span> were divided into five groups: Paris; Seine-Saint-Denis; Hauts-de-Seine; Val-de-Marne; Greater Paris (Essonne + Seine-et-Marne + Yvelines + Val-d'Oise). </br>
			Sample size = 25,714 respondents (no missing values).
			</ul>

		<p><span style = "font-weight : bold ;">Activity</span></p>
			<ul>
			We used trip purposes (initially in 9 groups) to define the various <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">activities</span> that the respondent engages in over the 24 hours of a day. 
			In contrast with indicators related to individual/household characteristics, <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">activity</span> may change for one respondent throughout the day. </br>
			We have focused on five groups of activity: At home; At work; Studying; Shopping; Leisure (recreational, cultural or sporting activities, family and personal visits).
			We have	excluded 'unspecified activity' and 'activity related to escorting or chauffeuring'. The sample of locations related to these activities was too small and it does not make sense to gather them with some other activities. </br>
			The sample size ranges from 22,425 respondents at 6 pm to 25,707 respondents at 3 pm when exploring activity pattern around the clock </p>

		<h2>GEOVISUALIZATION </h2>

		<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>The Mobiliscope has been integrally developed using front-end development technologies. 
		The layout has been developed with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript (without framework). 
		Data are stored in csv and geojson format on the webserver. </br>
		Data are visualized thanks to the <a style = "color : black ; text-decoration : underline ;" target="_blank"  href = "https://d3js.org/">D3.js visualisation library</span></a> developed by Mike Bostock.</p>
		

		<h3>Open-source script</h3>
		<p>Scripts are available on Github : <a href = "https://github.com/Geographie-cites/mobiliscope" style = "text-decoration : underline ; color : black ;"  target="_blank">https://github.com/Geographie-cites/mobiliscope</a></span>.</br>
		 They are licensed under the <a href = "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" style = "text-decoration : underline ; color : black ;"  target="_blank">GNU GPLv3</a></span> license (a free, copyleft license).</p>
		
		<h3>Maps & Graphs </h3>
		<p> We used the <a style = "color : black ; text-decoration : underlined ;" target="_blank"  href = "http://www.geotests.net/couleurs/gradients_inflex_en.html">color gradients explorer</a> developed by Laurent Jégou (assistant professor at Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès).</p>
		
		<p> In <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">choropleth maps</span> at district level (representing proportions of people in a specified group), five class have constantly been defined. 
		For each group, same class intervals apply over the 24h period.
		To account for confidence range in estimated proportions, intervals for the first and fifth classes cannot be inferior to 5% and intervals for the three intermediate classes cannot be inferior to 4%.</p>
		
		<p>In <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">proportional symbol maps</span>, circles are proportionally sized according to the number of people and are similar for all maps.</p>
		
		<p>In <span style = "font-weight : bold ;">flow maps</span>, circles are proportionally sized according to the number of non-resident people and are similar for all maps.
		Link thickness (displayed on mouseover) represents people flow from their districts of residence to the district where they are located.</br>
		For confidentiality and statistical power reasons, we introduced a filter for not displaying the estimated number of non-resident people when the crude number of concerned respondents was below 12.  
		Flow maps cannot be displayed for the group « at home » from « activity » indicator ».

		
	</p>
		
		<p> In <span style = "font-weight : bold ;"> graphs </span> representing Duncan or Moran indices, minimum and maximum values are similar for all groups of a same indicator which makes graphs comparable.
		Moreover, intervals between minimum and maximum values cannot be less than 0.4 not to give too much importance to minor variations in spatial structure (eg. sex).
