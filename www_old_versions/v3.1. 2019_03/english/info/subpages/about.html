    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="ss-style-dots">
        Mobiliscope is a geovisualization platform to explore present population in cities over a 24 hour time period.</br>
		With the Mobiliscope, let's discover how cities, neighborhood social composition and urban segregation change around the clock.</br>
		</br>

        Behind the Mobiliscope, there is a motivated <a href="/en/info/about/team">team</a> of geographers and geomaticians working in Géographie-cités laboratory (Paris, France) and also some supporting <a href="/en/info/about/partners">partners</a>.</br>
		</br>
 
		With the Mobiliscope licensed under the <a href="/en/info/about/license">GNU GPLv3 license</a> (a free, copyleft license), we want to take part to the open source community and open science.</br>
		</br>
		In the actual version, cities geovizualisation has been optimized for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and IE Edge. Please check your browser.
