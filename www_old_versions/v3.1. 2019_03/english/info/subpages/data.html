    <h2>Data</h2>
	<p>
		There are <b>22 french city regions</b> in the actual version of the Mobiliscope (2019).
	</p>

    <h3>Origin-destination surveys </h3>
    <p>
		Data came from 22 large 'Origin-Destination' surveys (Enquêtes Ménages-Déplacements - EMD / Enquête Globale Transport - EGT ; CEREMA), available from <a href = "http://www.progedo-adisp.fr/" target="_blank">ADISP</a> (National Archive of Data from Official Statistics in France).
		</br>
		In 'Origin-Destination' surveys, every trip made on the day before the survey was reported by respondents.
		Following variables were available for each trip: precise localization of place of departure and place of arrival, time of departure and time of arrival (with exact minutes), trip purpose and mode of transportation used.<b>The trip dataset</b> was transformed into a <b>location dataset</b> in which:
			<ul>
            <li>Every location was defined at district level (ie. the smallest unit in which it is relevant to aggregate data due to survey design);</li>
            <li>24 hourly time steps were defined to get 24 cross-sectional pictures of respondents' locations;</li>
            <li>Transportation periods were removed, except if respondents have reported to use an 'adherent' mode of transportation (ie. walking or cycling). In this case, half of the trip was considered as located in the district of origin and the other half as located in the district of destination. </li>
			</ul>
		</br>
	</p>
	<p>
		More methodological details can be found in the paper <a href = "https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01472039/document" target="_blank">Social segregation around the clock in the Paris region</a>.
	</p>

    <h3>Studied population </h3>
    <p>
		Only respondents <b>aged 16 years and over</b> (sufficiently autonomous in their daily mobility) have been selected. To reduce spatiotemporal heterogeneity between trips occurring on weekends and on weekdays, we also restricted our dataset to <b>weekday trips</b> (Monday-Friday).
		The sample of daily trips at weekends was indeed too small in 'Origin-Destination' surveys to explore what happens during the weekends.
		</br>
		Every measure published in the Mobiliscope has been estimated hourly (from 4:00 am to 3:00 am)taking into account <b>weighting coefficients</b>.
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>In the Paris Region (EGT, 2010), weighting coefficients have been computed at household and individual levels to grant every district with the same distribution in household profile (size and housing type) and population profile (age, sex, occupation, and socioprofessional group) as the distribution observed in the 2008 French census.</li>
			<li>In the other french cities region, weighting coefficients have been computed at household and individual levels to grant every district with the same distribution in household sizes and age groups as the distribution observed in French census.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

    <h3>Districts</h3>
    <p>
		Cities have been subdivided into <b>districts</b> (called 'secteurs' in french 'Origin-Destination' surveys).
		Districts are the primary sampling units in these survey.
		They correspond to groups of municipalities (or arrondissements in Paris, Lyon and Marseille). Their population size varies according to studied cities.
		Same number of inhabitants have been surveyed in every district.
		The Mobiliscope only displays the name of the three more populated municipalities in every district.
		</br>
		Districts are smaller in inner cities and larger in the peripheral areas.
