    <h2>Geovizualisation</h2>

    <p>
		The Mobiliscope has been integrally developed using front-end development technologies.</br>
		The layout has been developed with pure HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.</br>
		Data are stored in csv and geojson format on the webserver.</br>
		Data are visualized thanks to the <a  href = "https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" >D3.js visualisation library</a> developed by Mike Bostock.
		In the actual version, geovizualisation has been optimized for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and IE Edge. Please check your browser.

	<h3>Central map</h3>
    <p> 
		In <b>choropleth maps</b> (representing estimated <b>proportions</b> of people in a specified group at district level), five class have constantly been defined. For each group, same class intervals apply over the 24h period for all maps of the same city region.
		<ul>
			<li> For indicators related to sex, residential rings and activities, class intervals have been defined manually and are the same for every city;</li>
			<li> For other indicators (age; education level; socioprofessional status; occupational status and travel mode), we used quintile method based on values distribution over 24h period in every city. Class intervals can then diverge according to the city.</li>
			<li> In the Paris region, there are two additional indicators (household income and department of residence) for which class intervals ??? </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In <b>proportional symbol maps</b> (representing estimated <b>number</b> of people in a specified group at district level), circles are proportionally sized according to the number of people and are similar over the 24h period for all maps of the same city region (but can diverge according to the city region).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We used the <a target="_blank"  href = "http://www.geotests.net/couleurs/gradients_inflex_en.html">color gradients explorer</a> developed by Laurent Jégou (assistant professor at Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In <b>flow maps</b>, link thickness (displayed on mouseover) represents estimated flow of people from their districts of residence to the district where they are located. Link thickness are similar over the 24h period for all maps of the same city region (but can diverge according to the city region). Flow maps cannot be displayed for the group « at home » from « activity » indicator ».</br>
		
		For confidentiality and statistical power reasons, we introduced a filter for not displaying the estimated number of non-resident people when the crude number of concerned respondents was below 12.

	<h3>Top graph</h3>
	<p>
	In the top graph, two segregation indices measure spatial distribution over the 24h period in the whole city region
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Duncan’s dissimilarity index</b> gives information about the dispersal of every group across spatial units. It is commonly used as a measure of pairwise segregation (e.g. Black versus White) but can also be used when measuring segregation through an indicator divided in more than two groups. In this case, Duncan’s dissimilarity index expresses the proportion of individuals of a given group who would have to change spatial unit (without being replaced) to get an even distribution of the group relative to the total population. </li>
			<li><b>Moran’s index</b> is a measure of spatial autocorrelation. Its value varies from -1 (the group perfectly repulses itself) to 1 (the group is perfectly clustered in space). A zero value indicates an absence of spatial structure.</li>
		</ul></br>
	In graphs representing Duncan or Moran indices, minimum and maximum values are similar for all groups of a same indicator which makes graphs comparable.
	Moreover, intervals between minimum and maximum values cannot be less than 0.4 not to give too much importance to minor variations in spatial structure (eg. sex).
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bottom graph</h3>
	<p> 
	The bottom graph shows over the 24h period the estimated number/proportion of people in the district selected in the central map.
	Two modes are available : unique or stacked
