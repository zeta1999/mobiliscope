    Mobiliscope is a geovisualization platform that allows you to explore the present population in cities over a 24 hour period. With the Mobiliscope, we discover how cities, neighborhood social composition and urban segregation change around the clock.<br>
    <br>
    
    Behind the Mobiliscope, there is a <a href="/en/info/about/team">team</a> of geographers and geomaticians working in Géographie-cités laboratory (Paris, France) and as well as some supporting <a href="/en/info/about/partners">partners</a>.</br>
    <br>
    
    Mobiliscope is an open tool with a <a href = "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html"  target="_blank">copyleft licence</a>. Scripts are available on a public <a href = "https://github.com/Geographie-cites/mobiliscope" target="_blank">github</a> repository.</br>
    <br>
    
    Mobiliscope is under continual and active <a href="/en/info/about/evolution">development</a>. New cities and functions are regularly included.
